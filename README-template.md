## Table of Contents

Use for READMEs with more than 100 lines.

It should start with the next section; do not include the title or Table of Contents headings.

You can use [github-markdown-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) or a similar tool to generate it.

## Installation

### Requirements

Use this section to list unusual dependencies or dependencies that must be installed manually.

### Install using X

Instructions for the install, for example command of package manager like

    pip install requests

Add reference on used package manager or other details so users unfamiliar with this programming language understand the context.

Note the `pip` refers to the Python 3 package manager. In environment where Python 2 is also available the correct command may be `pip3`.

If the installation instructions are very complex or only relevant to specific environments or use cases, consider creating a separate INSTALL.md file and [linking it here](INSTALL.md).

## Usage

Code blocks illustrating common usage with explanation.

For CLI tools, prefix commands with `$ ` and include example output.

Use a paragraph instead of comment inside code block for explanation.

For longer examples, also include runnable script and link to it here.

Link to longer documentation if available here.

## Support

For any question on the usage of X please use the [Greenbone Community Portal](https://community.greenbone.net/c/X). If you found a problem with the software, please [create an issue](https://github.com/greenbone/X/issues) on GitHub. If you are a Greenbone customer you may alternatively or additionally forward your issue to the Greenbone Support Portal.

TODO: Replace X with project references!

## Contributing

Your contributions are highly appreciated. Please [create a pull request](https://github.com/greenbone/X/pulls) on GitHub. For bigger changes, please start a discussion with the development team via the [issues section at github](https://github.com/greenbone/X/issues) first.

TODO: Replace X with project references!

State here if contributions are welcome. State the requirements a contribution should meet to get merged.

Details about development, like creating a dev environment or running tests, also belong here, for example:

For development you should use [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to keep you python packages separated in different environments. First install pipenv via pip

    pip install --user pipenv

Afterwards run

    pipenv install --dev

in the checkout directory of X (the directory containing the Pipfile) to install all dependencies including the packages only required for development.

If there are more specific suggestions for development or suggestions only relevant to specific environments or use cases, consider creating a separate DEVELOPMENT.md file and [linking it here](DEVELOPMENT.md).
