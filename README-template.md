## Installation

### Requirements

Use this section to list unusual dependencies or dependencies that must be installed manually.

### Install using X

Instructions for installing, for example command of package manager like

    pip install requests

Add reference on used package manager or other details so users unfamiliar with this programming language understand the context.

Note the `pip` refers to the Python 3 package manager. In environment where Python 2 is also available the correct command may be `pip3`.

If the installation instructions are very complex or only relevant to specific environments or use cases, consider creating a separate documentation and linking it here.

## Usage

Code blocks illustrating common usage with explanation.

For CLI tools, prefix commands with `$ ` and include example output.

Use a paragraph instead of comment inside code block for explanation.

For longer examples, also include runnable script and link to it here.

Link to longer documentation if available here.

## Contributing

Your contributions are highly appreciated. Please [create a pull request](https://github.com/greenbone/PROJECT/pulls) on GitHub. Bigger changes need to be discussed with the development team via the [issues section at GitHub](https://github.com/greenbone/PROJECT/issues) first.

State here if contributions are welcome. State the requirements a contribution should meet to get merged.

Details about development, like creating a dev environment or running tests, also belong here, for example:

For development, you should use [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to keep your Python packages separated in different environments. First install pipenv via pip

    pip install --user pipenv

Afterwards run

    pipenv install --dev

in the checkout directory of PROJECT (the directory containing the Pipfile) to install all dependencies including the packages only required for development.

If there are more specific suggestions for development or guidelines for contributions, consider creating a separate documentation and linking it here.
